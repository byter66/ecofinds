        <h1>Return Policy</h1>
        <p>
            Thank you for shopping with us! We strive to provide quality
            second-hand items that are thoroughly inspected for functionality
            and condition. However, as these products are pre-owned, please
            review our return policy carefully before making a purchase.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Return Eligibility</h2>
        <p>
            You may request a return or exchange within
            <strong>7 days</strong> of receiving your order, provided that:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The item is in the condition described at the time of purchase.
            </li>
            <li>
                The defect or issue was not caused by misuse, neglect, or normal
                wear and tear expected from second-hand goods.
            </li>
            <li>
                All tags, accessories, and packaging (if applicable) are
                returned with the item.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Items Not Eligible for Return</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Items damaged after delivery due to mishandling or accidental
                drops.
            </li>
            <li>
                Products showing signs of excessive wear inconsistent with their
                description.
            </li>
            <li>Personal or intimate items (where applicable).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Return Process</h2>
        <p>To initiate a return:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contact our support team within 7 days of delivery.</li>
            <li>Provide photos or descriptions of the issue.</li>
            <li>
                Once approved, ship the item back to us within 5 days using the
                provided return label.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We recommend using tracked shipping to ensure the safe return of
            your item.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Refunds & Exchanges</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Upon receiving and inspecting the returned item, we will process
                a refund or offer an exchange.
            </li>
            <li>
                Refunds are issued to the original payment method and may take
                5-7 business days to reflect.
            </li>
            <li>
                In cases where normal wear and tear are present but do not
                affect functionality, we may not accept a return.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Warranty on Second-Hand Items</h2>
        <p>
            While we inspect and test every item before dispatch, please note
            that second-hand products inherently have reduced durability
            compared to new items. We offer a
            <strong>30-day limited warranty</strong> covering manufacturing
            defects or functional failures that existed at the time of saleâ€”not
            damage caused by usage or accidents.
        </p>
